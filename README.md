# Student Data Analysis
## Overview of Student Data Analysis
Pandas is a library for Python that is very useful in analyzing data.  With the use of Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, we are able to import CSV files, clean up the data, and generate statistics. In this project, we are able to analyze standard test data for PyCity Schools.  As a result, we are able to assess trends and statistics regarding test scores, school funding, and types of schools.
## PyCity Results
- The average math score for all students is 63.68
- The lowest reading score out of all of the students is 10.5
- The mean reading score for students in grades 11 and 12 is 74.90
- Public school have a higher budget ($911,195.56) compared to charter schools ($872,625.65)
- Montgomery High School had 2038 students, the most out of all the high schools
- Chang High School had 171 students, the least out of all the high schools
## Conclusion
All in all, we are able to remove any missing data points and clean up the data to do a very thorough analysis with Pandas on Jupyter Notebook.  These results can show a range of test scores, how students perform in each school, and school funding.  This can be very beneficial in budget proposal meetings to help prepare students for exams.
